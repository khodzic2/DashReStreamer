To run this test scenario use this terminal command:

python .\video_log_merger.py --parameter_type="config" --config_path="resources/config.ini"

This is example of how to run a script with scenario of segments downloaded from server using mpd file,
using config file to send parameters, and config.ini, gif.gif, and log.txt stored in resources folder.
Paths to them are send as relative paths, in general case, if files and folder are not in the working folder
use apsolute paths as parameters. Cleanup is "True" so all help except final video is deleted, to save it set
cleanup parameter as "False". For mpd url is used - http://cs1dev.ucc.ie/misl/4K_non_copyright_dataset/4_sec/x264/bbb/DASH_Files/full/dash_video_audio.mpd.
For other scenarios user can also send parameters from path, or specify paths to where segments are stored locally if so.

Install necessary modules from requirements.txt and also ffmpeg from official site and set it as enviroment variable.
