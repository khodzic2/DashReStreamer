# DashReStreamer

DashReStreamer is a framework for generating test video sequences with encoded stall and rate changes. It provides the functionality to reproduce network impact on video player performances by creating video clips including all resolution changes and re-buffering events. We achieve this functionality by utilising video logs generated by the client during the original stream of content in an uncontrolled environment (i.e., real production network).

    python video_log_merger.py    --path_to_log <input> --path_audio <colname> -o <output>
                [-v <vcodec>] [-a <acodec>]
                [-x <pixfmt>]
                [-s <spinner>] [--disable-spinner] [-p <speed>]
                [-t <trim>]
                [-r <brightness>]
                [-l <blur>]
                [--audio-disable]
                [--black-frame]
                [--force-framerate]
                [--skipping]
                [--verbose] [--version]
	
	
	
	
	
	--path_to_log Path where video log is stored
	--rep_lvl_col Column name where rep level is stored
	--seg_index_col Column name where chunk index is stored
	--stall_dur_col Column name where stall duration is stored
	--log_separator Separator style, tab or csv
	--path_audio Full path to where audio files are stored
	--path_video Full path to where video files are stored
	--dest_video Full path to working folder
	--gif_path Full path to gif
	--final_path Full path to place where to store final video
	--mpd_path URL where mpd with audio and video is
	--auto_scale If auto scale option is 0 it is off, if 1 then all video segments are rescaled to resolution of highest quality segment, if 2 aditional parameter scale_resolution is read
	--log_location local is for locally downloaded segments, mpd link is to download segments from server, where full link is sent as parameter
	--parameter_type Specifies how parameters are sent to script - path for sending parameters in console while calling script, and config for seting parameters in .ini file
