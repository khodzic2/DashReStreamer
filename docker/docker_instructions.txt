We also offer a docker container encompassing a working copy of DashReStreamer.

The initial release is v0.1.0

step 1 - start docker on your operating system
look here for install/build options https://docs.docker.com/desktop/

step 2 - pull the jjq52021/dash_re_streamer container(s)
options available for arm64 and amd64 architectures
docker pull jjq52021/dash_re_streamer (default amd64)
docker pull jjq52021/dash_re_streamer_arm64
docker pull jjq52021/dash_re_streamer_amd64

step 3 - run the container while linking the container to the 4K_dataset (or any content you wish)
this also takes into consideration the config file, so you can change the mpd urls or any other config.ini param, and other params, as needed
docker run -d -it --name dash_re_streamer \
-v "$(pwd)"/logMerger/input_files/4K_dataset:/home/logMerger/4K_dataset:ro \
-v "$(pwd)"/logMerger/input_files/config.ini:/home/logMerger/input_files/config.ini jjq52021/dash_re_streamer

step 4 - now attach the container to your terminal
docker attach dash_re_streamer

step 5 - run this command in the container
python3 ./video_log_merger.py --config_path ./resources/config.ini

step 6 - recover generated file
Assuming you do not change the params in the config.ini file, an output file, "log_short_video.mkv", will created in "./output_files/resources/segments/<date of test>/final"

Enjoy :)
